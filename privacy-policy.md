Privacy Policy

Last updated: 1. February 2026

This Privacy Policy describes how Monday Chrome Extension Helper (“the App”) collects, uses, and protects user data when connecting to monday.com.

Data Access and Usage

The App uses monday.com OAuth 2.0 to access data only after the user explicitly authorizes the connection. The App may access boards, items, updates, and attached assets solely to perform user-initiated actions such as viewing board data, adding updates, and uploading screenshots or forwarded content to selected items.

The App does not access or modify any data without direct user interaction.

Data Storage

OAuth access tokens are securely stored on a backend service and are never exposed to the Chrome extension or client-side code. No monday.com data is stored permanently outside of what is required to perform the requested action.

Data Sharing

The App does not sell, share, or transfer user data to third parties. Data is used exclusively to provide the functionality explicitly requested by the user.

Data Retention and Revocation

Access to monday.com data remains active only while the App is installed and authorized. Users may revoke access at any time by uninstalling the App or revoking permissions in monday.com.

Security

Reasonable technical and organizational measures are implemented to protect user data from unauthorized access.
